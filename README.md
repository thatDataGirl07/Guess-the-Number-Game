This is my first main project with Python. It is a simple game of guessing a number within any specific range you'd like (you can edit this in the code). 
The player of the game has the option of entering a name they'd like to go by.
The player is told the number of attempts they have.
If the user enters a 'string' instead of an 'int', an exception is raised.
There is also an option to play again or quit.
If you have any questions or comments regarding the code, please feel free to reach out.
